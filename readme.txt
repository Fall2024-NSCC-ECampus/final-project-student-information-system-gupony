**Student Information System**
This project is a Student Information System built for my PROG 2100 Final Project. The program allows you to manage student data, including adding, sorting, searching, and removing students. It also calculates letter grades based on customizable grade weights and can save/load data to/from a file.

**Features**
*Add, remove, and view student information.
*Sort students by last name (and first name if needed).
*Calculate and display letter grades dynamically.
*Save and load student data to/from a file.
*Adjust the weights for midterms and final exams for grade calculations.

**Structure**
*main.cpp: Handles the menu and overall program logic.
*Student.h: Defines the Student class with attributes and methods.
*Student.cpp: Implements the functionality for the Student class.
